##Example 2.1
An amplifier senses a sinusoidal signal and delivers a power of 0 dBm to a load resistance of 50 ohm.  Determine the peak-to-peak voltage swing across the load.

####Solution:
Since 0 dBm is equal to 1 mW, for a sinusoid having a peak-to-peak amplitude of Vpp and hence an rms value of $ Vpp / (2 \sqrt{2}) $

$ \frac{V_{pp}^2}{8\cdotR_L} $
